                        <p>Define the Helper marker for the system:
                            Here is the scenario of how the user should interact with the application:
                            • User types: @Helper
                            • System responds: @Helper-
                            • User adds marker name and period: @Helper-email.
                            • System searches for settings for email markers in the database. If not found, it prompts:
                            "Do you want to create a new marker with the name 'email' (y/n)?"
                            If the user types 'y', the system responds:
                            @Helper-email.
                            --Template
                            Please write here the template content. After finishing, go to the new line and type ‘— Wizard.’
                            • After the user completes the template, type –Wizard on the new line. For example, something like this:

                            @Helper-email.
                            --Template
                            Hello, {{name}}! This is an automated message from our system.
                            We are writing to inform you that your {{account}} is due for payment. Please log in to your account at {{url}} to make a payment.
                            Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
                            --Wizard


                            • System will return the list of placeholders with the questions marks on the end:
                            @Helper-email.
                            --Template

                            --Wizard
                            name?
                            account?
                            url?
                            • After the user completes the template by adding the questions, he adds @End at the end to indicate he wants to save the marker 'email' to the database.
                            Something like this, for example:
                            @Helper-email.
                            --Template
